digital platform to present vehicle inventory alongside financing options in a clear and trustworthy manner.\n\nThe objective was to improve clarity in the decision-making process while maintaining a professional automotive brand presence.\n\n---\n\n## 02 — Problem\n\nThe initial structure presented friction in three areas:\n\n- Financing options were visually disconnected from vehicle browsing  \n- Call-to-action elements lacked sufficient contrast  \n- Information density reduced scannability  \n\nUsers had to mentally connect pricing, financing and next steps without clear guidance.\n\n---\n\n## 03 — Objective\n\nDesign a structured browsing experience that:\n\n- Integrated financing information within the vehicle flow  \n- Strengthened primary and secondary CTAs  \n- Reduced cognitive load through clearer hierarchy  \n\nThe focus was clarity and guided progression rather than visual experimentation.\n\n---\n\n## 04 — Key UX Decisions\n\n### Integrated Financing Context\n\nInstead of separating financing into an isolated section, financing indicators were embedded within vehicle listings to maintain context during browsing.\n\n![Vehicle listing overview](/assets/img/projects/linermotors-listing.png)\n\nThis reduced the need for navigation jumps and supported faster evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### Hierarchical CTA System\n\nPrimary actions (e.g. financing inquiry) were visually reinforced using contrast and placement near pricing information.\n\nSecondary actions were visually softened to avoid competing with the main conversion path.\n\n---\n\n### Structured Information Blocks\n\nVehicle detail pages were reorganized into clearly segmented sections:\n\n- Core vehicle data  \n- Financing breakdown  \n- Contact action  \n\nThis created predictable scanning patterns and reduced visual noise.\n\n![Vehicle detail page](/assets/img/projects/linermotors-detail.png)\n\n---\n\n## 05 — Outcome\n\n- Improved clarity in
