I’m a Product Designer with a background in UI and development, focused on building structured digital systems that reduce operational friction and improve clarity.

My work sits at the intersection of design and logic. I approach products as interconnected systems — aligning user flows, business rules and operational processes into scalable solutions.

I value precision, simplicity and autonomy. For me, design is not decoration, but a tool to simplify complexity and enable better decisions.
