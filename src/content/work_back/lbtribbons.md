## 01 — Context

LBT Ribbons required a digital platform to present its thermal transfer ribbon products. The company had no structured catalog or centralized product information available online.

The objective was to create a clear and structured digital presence that could communicate technical specifications effectively.

---

## 02 — Problem

Three main issues were identified:

- No centralized product catalog  
- Technical information scattered across offline materials  
- No structured way to communicate product differences  

Potential clients lacked clarity regarding material types and application contexts.

---

## 03 — Objective

Design and develop a digital catalog that:

- Structured products by category (wax, wax-resin, resin)  
- Clearly presented technical specifications  
- Communicated application use cases by industry  

The focus was clarity and structured presentation rather than visual complexity.

---

## 04 — Information Architecture

Products were organized based on material type and industrial application.

Each product page included:

- Technical specifications  
- Recommended industry use  
- Performance characteristics

The architecture prioritized scannability and quick comparison.

## 05 — Key UX Decisions

### Clear Product Segmentation

Instead of presenting all products in a flat layout, items were grouped by material composition to simplify comparison.

---

### Technical Clarity

Specification blocks were visually separated to allow faster evaluation by procurement-oriented users.

---

### Minimal Visual Noise

The interface avoided decorative elements to keep attention on product data and application context.


---

## 06 — Outcome

- Established the first structured digital catalog for the company  
- Centralized technical product information  
- Improved clarity for B2B decision-making  

The result was a functional product platform focused on structured communication rather than visual embellishment.
