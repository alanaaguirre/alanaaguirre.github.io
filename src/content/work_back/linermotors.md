## 01 — Context

Liner Motors required a digital platform to present vehicle inventory alongside financing options in a clear and trustworthy manner.

The objective was to improve clarity in the decision-making process while maintaining a professional automotive brand presence.

---

## 02 — Problem

The initial structure presented friction in three areas:

- Financing options were visually disconnected from vehicle browsing  
- Call-to-action elements lacked sufficient contrast  
- Information density reduced scannability  

Users had to mentally connect pricing, financing and next steps without clear guidance.

---

## 03 — Objective

Design a structured browsing experience that:

- Integrated financing information within the vehicle flow  
- Strengthened primary and secondary CTAs  
- Reduced cognitive load through clearer hierarchy  

The focus was clarity and guided progression rather than visual experimentation.

---

## 04 — Key UX Decisions

### Integrated Financing Context

Instead of separating financing into an isolated section, financing indicators were embedded within vehicle listings to maintain context during browsing.

This reduced the need for navigation jumps and supported faster evaluation.

---

### Hierarchical CTA System

Primary actions (e.g. financing inquiry) were visually reinforced using contrast and placement near pricing information.

Secondary actions were visually softened to avoid competing with the main conversion path.

---

### Structured Information Blocks

Vehicle detail pages were reorganized into clearly segmented sections:

- Core vehicle data  
- Financing breakdown  
- Contact action  

This created predictable scanning patterns and reduced visual noise.

## 05 — Outcome

- Improved clarity in financing communication  
- Stronger action visibility  
- More structured browsing experience  

The platform positioned financing as part of the vehicle decision flow rather than an afterthought.
